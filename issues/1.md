### Problem:
We need to integrate a voice input button with voice-to-text transcription capability as part of a mixed modal input system. Currently, the path forward is unclear (multiple technologies/vendors exist, implementation approach TBD).

### Goals:
- Research potential transcription technologies and APIs (e.g., SpeechRecognition API, Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, AWS Transcribe, or others).
- Define technical requirements for integrating voice transcription as input.
- Spike out basic proof of concept for connecting UI element to transcription pipeline.

### Deliverables:
- A technical plan outlining the system architecture and chosen technology
- Feasibility validation/prototype showing basic transcription of voice input to text

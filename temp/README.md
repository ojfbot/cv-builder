# Temp Directory

This directory is used for temporary working versions and simulating production data responses during development.

## Structure

- `outputs/` - Temporary output files (resumes, analyses, etc.)
- `research/` - Temporary research data and findings
- `pipelines/` - Temporary pipeline configurations and results
- `toolbox/` - Temporary toolbox items and utilities

## Usage

This directory is gitignored and should only contain temporary working data. A proper storage solution will be implemented later.

## Important

Do not commit any files from this directory to version control. All contents are temporary and for development purposes only.

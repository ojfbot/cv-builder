It uses a simple, stable target (example.com) to verify that Playwright can launch in headless mode, navigate to a URL, wait for page load, query for elements, and capture screenshots both of full pages and specific elements."

The choice of example.com is deliberate - it's a minimal, stable page maintained by IANA that will not change, making it ideal for regression testing of the automation system itself rather than the CV Builder application."
